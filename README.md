Main Page
---------
The online service platform (OSP) lets customers order items and have these items delivered to them. The main page is where they can see the items.
Customers can place orders using the following steps:
  1. Customer adds items from the shop into the shopping cart using the drag and drop method
  2. Customer selects a branch for delivery and enters their login credentials
  3. When customer presses submit, they will be directed to a new page that shows the invoice summary and the delivery route on a map
  4. Customer accepts the invoice and submits
  5. A truck is assigned to the customer's order and a message is displayed to confirm the order

DB Maintain

This option found in the main page directs to DB Maintain.html and allows a database admin to do SQL actions. When they select a table and an action (insert, delete, update, select) they are directed to a new page that processes their input.

Search
------
When clicked, this option found in the main page makes a dialogue box appear. A user can enter an order ID in the dialogue box to search for their order. They will be directed to a new page (Search.php) that uses SQL queries to show the results.
